# Intelligent CCTV-AI Video Analysis for Construction Sites

This project, led by **Kumho Engineering & Construction**, focuses on building an AI-driven video analysis system using construction site CCTV footage to monitor safety, operations, and compliance in real time.

As a **Video Editor & Technical Content Creator**, my role centered on translating technical progress into engaging, informative, and visually clear videos to communicate system performance and value to diverse stakeholders.

## Main tasks:

- **AI model result visualization:** Edited footage and integrated overlays showing real-time detection of safety gear, movement patterns, and abnormal behaviors.

- **Technical demonstration video production:** Designed and edited videos that walk viewers through system functionalities, from video ingestion to detection outputs and alert generation.

- **Stakeholder presentation support:** Produced short promotional videos tailored for client meetings, investment presentations, and public release.

- **Toolchain:** Used Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects for editing, combined with assets from Python-based model outputs (e.g., YOLO, DeepSORT).
