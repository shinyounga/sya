# Smart Sensing Platform for Levee Failures

This project is part of a national strategic initiative funded by the **National Research Foundation of Korea** (NRF), titled _“Autonomous Evolutionary AI-Based Smart Sensing Platform for Early Detection and Proactive Response to Levee Failures”_ (Aug. 2024 – Present). I serve as the **Project Manager**, leading the development of a next-generation, AI-driven sensing system designed to enhance flood resilience.

## Main tasks:

- **AI-based early warning model:** Developed time-series forecasting models using deep learning to predict water level anomalies and detect potential levee breaches. Models include LSTM, TSMixer, and probabilistic approaches.

- **Edge AI integration:** Integrated lightweight models on embedded devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano) for real-time field monitoring without relying on cloud computation.

- **Real-time sensing dashboard:** Built a real-time web-based dashboard using Python, Dash, and Grafana to visualize water level trends, rainfall, and alert thresholds.

- **Autonomous response module:** Designed smart rule-based modules for proactive countermeasures, such as alerting local authorities and simulating emergency responses.

- **Project coordination:** Coordinated a multi-institution team, documented progress, and contributed to national disaster resilience strategies.

Due to the national security relevance of the system, source code access is restricted. However, results and insights will be shared through publications and academic presentations.
