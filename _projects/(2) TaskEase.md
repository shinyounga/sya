# Vision-Based Safety Monitoring for Temporary Structure Works

This project, funded by **The Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology and Advancement**, focuses on developing a vision-based system to enhance safety during the installation and dismantlement of **temporary structures** at construction sites — one of the most hazardous phases in construction.

The core objective is to detect the presence (or absence) of **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** such as helmets, vests, and safety harnesses using deep learning-based object detection models.

## Main tasks:

- **Custom PPE dataset development:** Collected and annotated hundreds of high-resolution construction site images capturing various PPE classes, weather conditions, and worker postures.

- **Object detection model training:** Fine-tuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 models using the custom dataset to detect helmets, vests, gloves, and safety harnesses in real time.

- **Evaluation under real conditions:** Tested the models in indoor/outdoor scenarios including occlusions, motion blur, and low light to evaluate robustness and generalization.

- **Pipeline for deployment:** Built a modular inference pipeline using OpenCV and ONNX to prepare the system for real-time integration with PTZ cameras or edge devices.

> This system contributes to preventing accidents and ensuring compliance with safety protocols, especially during high-risk, short-duration tasks like temporary structure dismantling.
